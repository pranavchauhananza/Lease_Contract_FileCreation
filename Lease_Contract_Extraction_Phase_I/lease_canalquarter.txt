                CHAPTER 3: RIGHTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF YOUR PROPERTY

By way of explanation: This Chapter sets out rights that are granted to YOU and those authorised by YOU for the benefit of YOUR
PROPERTY. They are subject to some limitations and some only apply if stated conditions are met.

RIGHTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF YOUR PROPERTY
1. If a parking space is marked on PLAN 1 with P followed by the plot number of YOUR PROPERTY, YOU
may use that space but only for the purposes of:
      parking one PRIVATE MOTOR VEHICLE which must not be a commercial vehicle (other than a light
       van which does not exceed 2,000 kg kerb weight); or
      but only if doing so does not cause disruption or obstruct or impede the use of the DEVELOPMENT
       ROADS and/or the ESTATE ROADS or other roads or any shared accessway or any adjoining parking
       space, for temporary parking of a caravan, purely for the purposes for loading and unloading and
       for a maximum period of 24 hours (with no return within 48 hours).
If no such parking space is marked on PLAN 1, YOUR PROPERTY does not benefit from any right to park
in a parking space on the ESTATE.
2. If any visitor parking spaces are marked on PLAN 2:
      YOU may park one PRIVATE MOTOR VEHICLE in any vacant visitor parking space; and
      but only if doing so does not cause disruption or obstruct or impede the use of the DEVELOPMENT
       ROADS and/or the ESTATE ROADS or other roads or any shared accessway or any adjoining
       parking space, you may temporarily park a caravan in any vacant visitor parking space, purely for
       the purposes for loading and unloading and for a maximum period of 24 hours (with no return
       within 48 hours),
but YOU may only park in a maximum of 3 visitor parking spaces at any one time. YOU acknowledge that
others have a similar right and visitor parking space availability is on a first come, first served basis and
may be used for a maximum of 48 hours with no return to any of the visitor parking spaces within 48
hours. If no such visitor parking spaces are marked on PLAN 2, YOUR PROPERTY does not benefit from
any right to visitor parking.
3. YOU may enter other parts of the BUILDING if necessary for the purpose of YOU complying with YOUR
obligations in THIS LEASE subject to YOU complying with the ENTRY CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS. YOU
acknowledge that others in the BUILDING may have similar rights.
4. YOUR PROPERTY has the right of support, shelter and protection from the rest of the BUILDING.
By way of explanation: YOUR PROPERTY has the right to be physically supported (held up) by the parts of the BUILDING beneath it,
and to be sheltered by the parts of the BUILDING around and above it.

5. For the purposes of substances, energy and data passing to and from YOUR PROPERTY:
      YOU may use and connect into any CONDUITS within the BUILDING that are capable of benefiting YOUR
       PROPERTY subject to YOU complying with the ENTRY CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS where YOU are
       making any new connection; and
      YOU may use any other CONDUITS within the ESTATE that are capable of benefiting YOUR PROPERTY.
YOU acknowledge that others in the BUILDING and on the ESTATE may have similar rights and that any such
CONDUITS may be re-routed or replaced or, where reasonable to do so, removed by the LANDLORD or the
MANAGEMENT COMPANY.
                                                                                                                             Page 8 of 56
6. YOU may use the COMMON PARTS for the purposes for which they are designed which includes the
use of an appropriate route from the entrance of the BUILDING to YOUR PROPERTY.
7. YOU may use the COMMUNAL AREAS for the purposes for which they are designed which includes
using the DEVELOPMENT ROADS the ESTATE ROADS and other roads and FOOTPATHS that form part of
the COMMUNAL AREAS for the purpose of getting to and from YOUR PROPERTY and any parking space in
which YOU have a right to park and for the purpose of accessing other parts of the COMMUNAL AREAS.
However:
     YOU may not use the DEVELOPMENT ROADS and/or any ESTATE ROADS or other roads forming
      part of the COMMUNAL AREAS for parking;
     where any DEVELOPMENT ROAD and/or ESTATE ROAD or other road passes under any building or
      structure on the ESTATE, YOU may not use the DEVELOPMENT ROADS and/or the ESTATE ROADS or
      other roads in any vehicle which is high enough to cause any contact with such building or
      structure;
     YOU may not use any FOOTPATHS forming part of the COMMUNAL AREAS unless YOU are on foot;
      and
     YOU may only use a bicycle or bin store (in either case) if it is marked on PLAN 1 and if no bin store
      is marked on PLAN 1 then YOUR PROPERTY does not benefit from any right to use a bin store and
      if no bicycle store is marked  on PLAN 1 then YOUR PROPERTY does not benefit from any right to use
      a bicycle store.
8. If access to YOUR PROPERTY from the ESTATE ROADS and/or the DEVELOPMENT ROADS and/or other
roads and FOOTPATHS is via any shared accessway (for example any pathway, drivethrough, road or
driveway) this is marked on PLAN 1 and YOU may use that accessway for the purposes of getting to and
from YOUR PROPERTY in accordance with any reasonable regulations notified to YOU by the MANAGEMENT
COMPANY. If no such shared accessway is marked on the plan, YOUR PROPERTY does not benefit from any
right to use such an accessway.

LIMITATIONS ON THE RIGHTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF YOUR PROPERTY
9. The rights must be exercised in accordance with YOUR obligations in THIS LEASE, in accordance with the
DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS, the ESTATE REGULATIONS and so as to cause as little inconvenience as
reasonably possible to the LANDLORD, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY, the DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT
COMPANY and other owners of land on the ESTATE.
10. The LANDLORD or the MANAGEMENT COMPANY or the DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY may
control the use of the DEVELOPMENT ROADS and/or the ESTATE ROADS and/or the FOOTPATHS that form part
of the COMMUNAL AREAS by way of locked gates, security barriers and/or any other appropriate controls
as long as YOU are provided with passwords, keycards or other appropriate means to allow YOU to pass
through those controls.

                                                                                                             Page 9 of 56
11. If a parking space is marked on PLAN 1 with P followed by the plot number of YOUR PROPERTY, the
LANDLORD or the MANAGEMENT COMPANY may at any time and for any reason allocate YOU an alternative
parking space within the ESTATE and YOUR right to park will instead apply to that alternative space.
Alternative parking spaces may be allocated any number of times. YOU accept that any right YOU may
have under THIS LEASE to use a parking space (and any alternative parking space allocated in its place)
may be temporarily restricted or removed during the carrying out of any works to the parking space or
other parts of the ESTATE that the MANAGEMENT COMPANY is obliged or entitled to carry out under THIS
LEASE.
12. If any visitor parking spaces are marked on PLAN 2, the LANDLORD or the MANAGEMENT COMPANY may
at any time and for any reason reduce the number of visitor parking spaces or remove them altogether.
Any right to park on any visitor parking space ends if the visitor parking spaces are removed.
13. If any shared accessway is marked on PLAN 1, the LANDLORD or the MANAGEMENT COMPANY may at
any time and for any reason allocate YOU an alternative suitable means of accessing YOUR PROPERTY from
the ESTATE ROADS, the DEVELOPMENT ROADS and FOOTPATHS and YOUR access right will instead apply
to that alternative. Alternatives may be allocated any number of times.
14. No rights are granted or transferred other than as expressly set out in this Chapter. In particular, YOUR
PROPERTY does not benefit from any rights of light or rights of air.

By way of explanation: YOU will have the rights set out in this Chapter. YOU will not have any other rights – the rights above are
the only ones YOU will have. Other buildings constructed in the future could potentially reduce the amount of natural light into YOUR
PROPERTY, or affect the view from YOUR PROPERTY.



                                                                                                                                Page 10 of 56
            CHAPTER 4: LANDLORD'S RESERVED RIGHTS AND OTHER RIGHTS

By way of explanation: This Chapter sets out rights that are retained by the LANDLORD. They are for the benefit of the BUILDING
and the ESTATE. They can be exercised by the LANDLORD, the DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY, the MANAGEMENT
COMPANY and to the extent stated below, others, as well as those authorised by any of them.
LANDLORD'S RESERVED RIGHTS

1. The right of support, shelter and protection for the BUILDING from YOUR PROPERTY.

By way of explanation: The parts of the BUILDING above YOUR PROPERTY have the right to be physically supported (held up) by
YOUR PROPERTY. The parts of the BUILDING below or adjacent to YOUR PROPERTY have the right to be sheltered by YOUR PROPERTY.
2. The right to keep, connect into, maintain, renew, use and install any CONDUITS or FACILITIES which are
within or partly within the boundaries of YOUR PROPERTY but which may be used for the benefit of any other
property.
3. The right to enter YOUR PROPERTY:
      to exercise the rights referred to in this Chapter;
      to carry out any inspection or survey for any reasonable purpose including for the purpose of
       determining whether YOU have failed to comply with any of YOUR obligations in THIS LEASE;
      to carry out work to the BUILDING or to the DEVELOPMENT or to the ESTATE; and
      for any other purpose connected with the LANDLORD's interest in the BUILDING or the DEVELOPMENT
       or  the   ESTATE     or   for  the   purpose     of  the   LANDLORD       or   the   MANAGEMENT        COMPANY       or   the
       DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY complying with an obligation under THIS LEASE or any other
       agreement (whether that agreement is entered into on, before or after the date of THIS LEASE).
When     exercising     this   right,  the   LANDLORD       or   the   MANAGEMENT         COMPANY       or   the   DEVELOPMENT
MANAGEMENT COMPANY must give YOU at least 48 hours' notice (unless there is an emergency) which may
be given by telephone, email or any other appropriate method, cause as little damage and inconvenience
to YOU as possible and promptly repair any damage caused.
4.The right to enter YOUR PROPERTY to carry out work that YOU are required to do under THIS LEASE but
have failed to do after having been given reasonable opportunity to do so as further explained in Chapter
9 or in the event of an emergency.
5. The right to carry out building, demolition and other works on any part of the BUILDING, the ESTATE and
the DEVELOPMENT and any other property which the LANDLORD holds from time to time including the right
to erect scaffolding against the BUILDING or any building or structure on the ESTATE, bring construction
vehicles and equipment onto the ESTATE, oversail the BUILDING and the ESTATE with construction
equipment and carry out any work to extend the BUILDING (upwards or otherwise) even if this reduces the
amount of light or air that YOUR PROPERTY enjoys or temporarily interferes with YOUR use and enjoyment
of YOUR PROPERTY or the rights granted to YOU in THIS LEASE.

By way of explanation: A right to "oversail" the BUILDING and the ESTATE means the right for cranes and other construction
equipment to pass overhead.

6. The rights referred to in this Chapter under the heading "LANDLORD's reserved rights" may be exercised
by or on behalf of the LANDLORD or the DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY or the MANAGEMENT
COMPANY.

                                                                                                                           Page 11 of 56
OTHER RIGHTS

7.THIS LEASE is granted subject to all rights, obligations, restrictions and other matters affecting YOUR
PROPERTY. They include all matters contained or referred to in the property and charges register of the
LANDLORD's title number (as set out in LR2.1 of the PRESCRIBED CLAUSES) as at the date of THIS LEASE so
far as they relate to YOUR PROPERTY and are still in existence and capable of taking effect.

                                                                                                            Page 12 of 56
                                     CHAPTER 5: MONEY YOU MUST PAY
1. YOU agree to pay:
      YOUR SHARE of the SERVICE CHARGE as set out in Chapter 6;
      interest as set out in this Chapter 5;
      any VAT that is due on any payment YOU are required to make under THIS LEASE as set out in this
       Chapter 5;
      one peppercorn per year to be paid to the LANDLORD if the LANDLORD requests that YOU do so;
      all applicable EVENT FEES and CONSENT FEES as set out in THIS LEASE; and
      any other payment that YOU are required to make under THIS LEASE;

By way of explanation: To make sure THIS LEASE is legally valid, it needs to provide for the payment of rent every year. In practice,
the LANDLORD does not wish to charge any rent, and so the rent is set at one peppercorn per year (known as a 'peppercorn rent').
YOU only have to send the peppercorn if the LANDLORD specifically asks YOU to. In practice, it would be very unusual to be asked
to do this, though YOU are obliged to send the peppercorn if the LANDLORD specifically asks YOU to.

2. Any sums that YOU are required to pay to the LANDLORD are payable as rent.
3. YOU are responsible for paying for the supply and removal of all utilities and services in respect of YOUR
PROPERTY (for example water, sewage, electricity and internet) and any outgoings (such as council tax
and the expense from time to time incurred in respect of cleaning, maintaining, repairing and renewing all
party walls, fences and other such items and any facilities the benefit of which is shared between YOU and
others) including any which may be required, installed, provided or imposed in the future except where
such items are either payable by YOU as part of the SERVICE CHARGE or under some other arrangements
set out in THIS LEASE. If any utilities, services or outgoings are used by or attributed to YOUR PROPERTY
(whether in whole or in part) but are invoiced to the LANDLORD, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY or any other
person, YOU must pay a fair share of the costs of that utility, service or outgoing to the person who received
the invoice when asked to do so. If the invoice is issued to the LANDLORD, the LANDLORD acting reasonably
will decide what a fair share is and otherwise, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY acting reasonably will decide
what is a fair share.
4. If the LANDLORD or the MANAGEMENT COMPANY pay any invoice relating to any utility, service or outgoing
attributed to YOUR PROPERTY, YOU must refund the amount paid when asked to do so.
5. All sums referred to in THIS LEASE are exclusive of VAT. Where VAT is chargeable on any amount of
money due from YOU, YOU are required to pay the VAT on that amount.
6. YOU must pay all sums payable by YOU under THIS LEASE without deduction, whether by way of set off
(whether legal or equitable), counterclaim, withholding (save of tax as required by law) or otherwise. In
relation to any sum payable by YOU under THIS LEASE, YOU owe this obligation to the person to whom YOU
must pay that sum.

By way of explanation: YOU are not entitled to make deductions from the sums payable by YOU in respect of YOUR SHARE of SERVICE
CHARGE or in respect of any interest or in respect of any other matter for which YOU are obliged to make any payment under THIS
LEASE, even if they are deductions for sums which YOU think the LANDLORD or MANAGEMENT COMPANY or other person to whom
YOU are making the payment owes YOU.
7. If YOU do not pay any sum due from YOU to the LANDLORD or to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY under THIS
LEASE within 21 days of the date on which it was due to be paid then provided that the sum has been
formally demanded, YOU must pay interest on that sum at the interest rate. The interest rate is 4% a year
above the base rate of Barclays Bank plc or 4% a year if that base rate is below 0% or ceases to be

                                                                                                                                Page 13 of 56
published. Interest will be calculated on a daily basis, from and including the date on which the relevant
sum was due to be paid until the date that payment of the relevant sum, together with any interest due, is
actually received by the person to whom it is owed and will apply both before and after any judgment.
8. The right to charge YOU interest on any sum due does not affect any other remedy that the LANDLORD
or the MANAGEMENT COMPANY may have to recover money due from YOU under THIS LEASE.

                                                                                                            Page 14 of 56
                     CHAPTER 6: SERVICES AND THE SERVICE CHARGE

MANAGEMENT COMPANY'S OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE SERVICES

1. Subject to YOU paying YOUR SHARE of the SERVICE CHARGE, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY agrees with
YOU to provide the BUILDING SERVICES and the ESTATE SERVICES for the benefit of YOUR PROPERTY and
other properties on the ESTATE. The total costs incurred by or on behalf of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY in
connection with providing the BUILDING SERVICES and the ESTATE SERVICES are referred to as the SERVICE
CHARGE and the SERVICE CHARGE is recovered by the MANAGEMENT COMPANY from those who own
property that benefits from the BUILDING SERVICES and the ESTATE SERVICES. YOU agree to pay YOUR
SHARE of the SERVICE CHARGE to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY as set out in this Chapter. Nothing in this
paragraph entitles the MANAGEMENT COMPANY not to obtain all insurances that it is obliged to obtain under
its obligations in Chapter 7 by reason of YOU not paying any part of the SERVICE CHARGE that is payable
by YOU.

THE SERVICES

2. The BUILDING SERVICES are all services reasonably required for the efficient running and management
of the BUILDING. The BUILDING SERVICES at the date of THIS LEASE include those listed under the heading
"Services provided to the COMMON PARTS and SERVICED AREAS" in the definition of SPECIFIED SERVICES in
Chapter 16 but the MANAGEMENT COMPANY may add to any of these services where, in the MANAGEMENT
COMPANY's reasonable opinion, it is reasonable to do so in the interests of good estate management. The
MANAGEMENT COMPANY may also alter or discontinue any of these services where, in the MANAGEMENT
COMPANY's reasonable opinion any of the following are the case: it has become impracticable or obsolete
to provide it, it is in the general interest of the owners or occupiers of the LETTABLE UNITS to discontinue it
or it is in the interests of good estate management to discontinue it. If the MANAGEMENT COMPANY proposes
to discontinue any of the BUILDING SERVICES, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY will notify YOU and will take YOUR
view and those of others affected into account in making its decision whether or not to discontinue that
service.
3. The ESTATE SERVICES are all services reasonably required for the efficient running and management of
the ESTATE. The ESTATE SERVICES at the date of THIS LEASE include those listed under the heading
"Services provided to the ESTATE" in the definition of SPECIFIED SERVICES in Chapter 16 but the
MANAGEMENT COMPANY may add to any of these services where in the MANAGEMENT COMPANY's
reasonable opinion, it is reasonable to do so in the interests of good estate management. The
MANAGEMENT COMPANY may also alter or discontinue any of these services where, in the MANAGEMENT
COMPANY's reasonable opinion any of the following are the case:  it has become impracticable or obsolete
to provide it, it is in the general interest of the owners or occupiers of premises on the ESTATE to discontinue
it or it is in the interests of good estate management to discontinue it. If the MANAGEMENT COMPANY
proposes to discontinue any of the ESTATE SERVICES, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY will notify YOU and will
take YOUR view and those of others affected into account in making its decision whether or not to
discontinue that service.

THE SERVICE CHARGE

4. All costs that are incurred by or on behalf of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY in connection with providing
the BUILDING SERVICES or the ESTATE SERVICES form part of the SERVICE CHARGE including the SERVICE
COSTS. It is agreed that the MANAGEMENT COMPANY may not include in the SERVICE CHARGE any share of
the SERVICE CHARGE that is fairly attributable to any property benefiting from the BUILDING SERVICES or the
                                                                                                               Page 15 of 56
ESTATE SERVICES where that property is occupied by the LANDLORD or is intended to be let but is unlet and
is owned by the LANDLORD. The MANAGEMENT COMPANY will invoice that share to the LANDLORD. It is also
agreed that the MANAGEMENT COMPANY may not include in the SERVICE CHARGE for a SERVICE CHARGE
PERIOD any share of the SERVICE CHARGE that is fairly attributable to a RELEVANT PARCEL unless that
SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD is either current at that RELEVANT PARCEL's EFFECTIVE DATE or arises after that
RELEVANT PARCEL's EFFECTIVE DATE.
5. All costs that are incurred by or on behalf of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY in connection with the insurance
policies and cover referred to in Chapter 7 form part of the SERVICE CHARGE. These costs include
premiums, commissions, fees and the cost of valuations.
6. All costs referred to in THIS LEASE as forming part of the SERVICE CHARGE form part of the SERVICE
CHARGE.
7. All sums in respect of establishing, maintaining and operating reserve funds and/or sinking funds that
the MANAGEMENT COMPANY includes in the SERVICE CHARGE in accordance with its right to do so under
this Chapter form part of the SERVICE CHARGE.
OFF-ESTATE CONTRIBUTIONS TO SERVICE CHARGE - PAYMENT OF COSTS AND EXPENSES INCURRED
IN RESPECT OF THE PUBLIC OPEN SPACE AND ACOUSTIC FENCES

8. The expenses incurred by the LANDLORD or the MANAGEMENT COMPANY in paying the costs incurred by
the DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY or its agents of maintaining insuring repairing monitoring
 cultivating and/or cleaning the PUBLIC OPEN SPACE and any play equipment or other apparatus situated
thereon and re-charged to the LANDLORD or the MANAGEMENT COMPANY or its agents until the date being
the earlier of the transfer of the maintenance responsibility or the transfer of the legal ownership of the
PUBLIC OPEN SPACE or any part thereof to the COUNCIL and/or the RESERVE MANAGER
9. Should the COUNCIL and/or the RESERVE MANAGER decide to decline the transfer of the PUBLIC OPEN
SPACE or any part thereof referred to in clause 8 above under the terms of the SECTION 106 AGREEMENT
(AYLESBURY) any sums required to be paid to the DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY by the LANDLORD
or the MANAGEMENT COMPANY for the maintenance insurance repair monitoring cultivating and/or cleaning
of the PUBLIC OPEN SPACE and any play equipment or other apparatus situated thereon
10. The costs incurred by THE DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY or its agents of maintaining insuring
repairing monitoring  the ACOUSTIC FENCE(S) and re-charged to the LANDLORD or the MANAGEMENT
COMPANY or its agents PROVIDED THAT if the AUTHORITY choses to replace the ACOUSTIC FENCE(S) with
an alternative fence of its own design the DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY shall no longer be
obliged to maintain the same

RESERVE FUNDS AND SINKING FUNDS

11. The MANAGEMENT COMPANY is entitled to establish, maintain and operate sinking funds and reserve
funds in respect of future expenditure, whether recurring or not and whenever in the future such
expenditure may or may be expected to arise. The MANAGEMENT COMPANY may set up such sinking and
reserve funds in accordance with the principles of good estate management for:
     carrying out any works of any kind to any part of the ESTATE at any time; and

     to the extent not included in the foregoing description, for any purposes connected to the provision

                                                                                                            Page 16 of 56
       of the BUILDING SERVICES or the ESTATE SERVICES.
The works for which such sinking and reserve funds may be established, maintained and operated that
are referred to in this paragraph at the first bullet point above include but are not limited to renewal and
replacement of any plant, machinery, equipment and system, repair, renewal and replacement of any
structural parts of the ESTATE (including but not limited to the structural parts of any building or other
structure on the ESTATE), decoration, repair and maintenance of the exterior of any building or other
structure on the ESTATE, planting, surfacing and cultivating any external landscaping on any part of the
ESTATE, carrying out works to comply with legal obligations and to the extent commensurate with the
principles of good estate management relating to the establishment, maintenance and operation of sinking
funds and reserve funds, any other repair, decoration, refurbishment and other kind of maintenance for
which the MANAGEMENT COMPANY is responsible under the terms of any leases or transfers of premises
on the ESTATE.
12. The MANAGEMENT COMPANY may include in the SERVICE CHARGE for any SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD
reasonable sums to establish, maintain and operate the reserve funds and/or sinking funds referred to in
the preceding paragraph (including an appropriate amount for VAT and fees). The matters to which such
sums may relate include but are not limited to any of the items set out in the definition of SERVICE COSTS,
whether any such expenditure arises or is expected to arise once or periodically and if periodically, whether
recurring at regular or irregular intervals.

By way of explanation: it is sensible to build up a reserve and/or sinking fund to allow for any major and/or irregular costs that will
form part of the SERVICE CHARGE to be spread over a number of SERVICE CHARGE PERIODs. Without such funds, the burden of major
and/or irregular costs may be required from owners of premises in the BUILDING or on the ESTATE when the expenditure is incurred,
which could result in a demand for large or immediate payment. For example, if the roof needed to be replaced but there was no
reserve fund and/or sinking fund, the SERVICE CHARGE for that SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD would be unusually high. Building up a
reserve fund and/or sinking fund on an ongoing basis also ensures that those that own the freehold or certain leaseholds of
premises in the BUILDING or on the ESTATE from time to time contribute to such costs. Otherwise, the burden of major and/or
irregular costs would sit only with those people who happen own the freehold or certain leaseholds of premises in the BUILDING or
on the ESTATE when the expenditure is incurred, which could be unfair. Bear in mind that even with a reserve fund and/or sinking
fund, there may not be enough SERVICE CHARGE money in such funds to cover all the costs of the services provided. If that happens,
YOU and other leaseholders and/or owners of properties on the ESTATE would be required to cover the shortfall as part of the
SERVICE CHARGE.

PAYING YOUR SHARE OF THE SERVICE CHARGE

13. YOU will pay YOUR SHARE of the SERVICE CHARGE for each SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD (apportioned on a
daily basis for the SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD current at the date of THIS LEASE). At the date of THIS LEASE,
the SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD is every 12 month period ending on 30 June each year.
14. For each SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY will give YOU a written budget showing
the ESTIMATED SERVICE CHARGE for that SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD and an invoice for the sum that YOU are
required to pay to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY in advance on account of YOUR SHARE of the SERVICE
CHARGE for that SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD. This sum will be the MANAGEMENT COMPANY's estimate of YOUR
SHARE of the SERVICE CHARGE for the upcoming SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD.

By way of explanation: In order that the MANAGEMENT COMPANY has the necessary funds to provide the BUILDING SERVICES and the
ESTATE SERVICES during a given SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY will obtain advance payments from YOU
representing YOUR SHARE of the ESTIMATED SERVICE CHARGE for each upcoming SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD. After the end of the SERVICE
CHARGE PERIOD, the actual SERVICE CHARGE is known and the MANAGEMENT COMPANY will determine whether the advance payments
that YOU have made cover YOUR SHARE of the actual SERVICE CHARGE and a reconciliation is carried out.

                                                                                                                                 Page 17 of 56
15. YOU will pay the invoiced sum to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY as directed by the MANAGEMENT COMPANY
provided that the sum will be payable in no fewer than 2 equal instalments and on the payment dates
specified from time to time by the MANAGEMENT COMPANY. At the date of THIS LEASE, the sum is payable
in 2 equal instalments on each of 1 January and 1 July. On the date of THIS LEASE, YOU will pay the first
payment on account of YOUR SHARE of the SERVICE CHARGE for the SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD current at the
date of THIS LEASE.
16. If the MANAGEMENT COMPANY has not given YOU the written budget for a SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD, the
MANAGEMENT COMPANY may give YOU an invoice requiring payment of a sum no greater than the sum
invoiced for the advance payment on account of YOUR SHARE of the SERVICE CHARGE in the previous
SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD. That sum will be payable in the same number of instalments and on the same
dates as was required in the previous SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD. YOU will pay the invoiced sum to the
MANAGEMENT COMPANY but this invoice may be adjusted at any time by the MANAGEMENT COMPANY
following the written budget for the new SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD being given to YOU. If any additional
amount is due from YOU, YOU will pay this to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY within one month of the date of
the adjusted invoice and if YOU have made an over-payment, an amount equal to that over-payment will
be deducted from the next sum or sums due from YOU to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY under this Chapter.
17. Where the MANAGEMENT COMPANY does not have sufficient funds to repair UNINSURED DAMAGE or there
is any kind of emergency requirement for immediate funds, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY will revise its
written budget which shows the ESTIMATED SERVICE CHARGE for that SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD and issue to
YOU an invoice for an additional sum that YOU are required to pay to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY in advance
on account of YOUR SHARE of the SERVICE CHARGE for that SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD. YOU will pay this
additional sum to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY within one month of the date of the invoice.
18. As soon as practicable after the end of the SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY will
set out the actual SERVICE CHARGE in the SERVICE CHARGE STATEMENT. The MANAGEMENT COMPANY will
send YOU a copy of the SERVICE CHARGE STATEMENT . Then 2 months after the MANAGEMENT COMPANY
has sent YOU a copy of the SERVICE CHARGE STATEMENT or if later, after any obvious and significant errors
that have been notified to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY have been corrected, the SERVICE CHARGE
STATEMENT will be treated as having been accepted as conclusive by YOU, the LANDLORD and the
MANAGEMENT COMPANY as to the amount of the SERVICE CHARGE and YOUR SHARE of the SERVICE CHARGE.
19. The SERVICE CHARGE STATEMENT will include YOUR balancing invoice. This invoice will show the
amount that YOU have paid in advance on account of YOUR SHARE of the SERVICE CHARGE for the relevant
SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD and the amount that represents YOUR SHARE of the actual SERVICE CHARGE for
that SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD.
20. If the amount that YOU have paid on account is less than YOUR SHARE of the SERVICE CHARGE as set
out in the SERVICE CHARGE STATEMENT, YOU must pay the balance to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY within
14 days of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY sending YOU the SERVICE CHARGE STATEMENT.
21. If the amount that YOU have paid on account is more than YOUR SHARE of the SERVICE CHARGE as set
out in the SERVICE CHARGE STATEMENT, the balance will be first applied to pay any money that YOU owe to
the MANAGEMENT COMPANY and any remaining balance will be deducted from the next sum or sums due
from YOU to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY under this Chapter.



                                                                                                            Page 18 of 56
PROVISION OF SERVICE CHARGE INFORMATION

22. When reasonably requested by YOU, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY will make available to YOU the records
and vouchers relating to the provision of the BUILDING SERVICES and the ESTATE SERVICES by making them
available at such location as the MANAGEMENT COMPANY may reasonably appoint for the purposes of
inspection during normal business hours.

OMISSIONS FROM THE SERVICE CHARGE BUDGET OR SERVICE CHARGE STATEMENT
23. The MANAGEMENT COMPANY may sometimes omit to include SERVICE CHARGE expenditure either spent
or for which liability is incurred in a given SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD in the SERVICE CHARGE budget or
SERVICE CHARGE STATEMENT for that SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD. If this happens, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY
may still include that expenditure or liability in the SERVICE CHARGE budget or SERVICE CHARGE STATEMENT
for any subsequent SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD.

HOW PAYMENTS OF SERVICE CHARGE MUST BE HELD

24. Other than sums invested in accordance with this Chapter, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY will keep all
money received from YOU and others in respect of the SERVICE CHARGE in a designated account or a trust
account separate from any other money until it is properly spent. Any interest earned on that account will
be credited to the account.

MANAGEMENT COMPANY'S OBLIGATION TO COMPLY WITH LAWS

25. The MANAGEMENT COMPANY will comply with all applicable laws relating to the recovery of YOUR SHARE
of the SERVICE CHARGE from YOU.

MANAGEMENT COMPANY'S OBLIGATION REGARDING SEEKING VALUE FOR MONEY

26. The MANAGEMENT COMPANY agrees with YOU that it will use reasonable efforts to get value for money
when it incurs costs that will form part of the SERVICE CHARGE. It is agreed that this does not require the
MANAGEMENT COMPANY to seek the lowest cost available or accept the lowest quote received but where
appropriate, it may require the MANAGEMENT COMPANY to obtain more than one quote for proposed works,
require competitive tenders or check the costs of alternative suppliers at suitable intervals.

MANAGEMENT COMPANY'S POWERS OF INVESTMENT

27. The MANAGEMENT COMPANY may invest all or any part of the sums paid to it on account of SERVICE
CHARGE under THIS LEASE:
     in deposits with or loans to any recognised "bank" (within the meaning of the Banking Act 1987) or
      local authority or in securities having a final redemption date not later than 5 years after the date
      they were acquired and issued by the United Kingdom's government or by any local or public
      authority or nationalised industry or undertaking in the United Kingdom or in building  society stock
      or accounts; and
     jointly with any other funds;
and may delegate its powers of investment within such investment policy or other limits as it thinks fit to
any member of the London Stock Exchange and may pay them to carry out the powers it delegates.


                                                                                                            Page 19 of 56
RECOVERY OF OTHER SERVICE CHARGE CONTRIBUTIONS

28. Subject to YOU complying fully with YOUR obligations in the next paragraph, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY
will take reasonable steps to recover contributions towards SERVICE CHARGE which are payable by the
other owners of premises on the ESTATE under their leases or transfers.
29. YOU agree with the MANAGEMENT COMPANY that:
     YOU will indemnify and reimburse the MANAGEMENT COMPANY against all costs of complying with the
      MANAGEMENT        COMPANY's       obligations    in   the   previous     paragraph     (including    reasonable
      reimbursement for the time spent by the MANAGEMENT COMPANY or by someone authorised by it);
     YOU will provide such security in cleared funds as the MANAGEMENT COMPANY thinks fit and YOU
      agree that the MANAGEMENT COMPANY is not required to take or continue any action or incur any
      costs under its obligations in the previous paragraph until YOU or YOUR mortgagee has done so;
     if the MANAGEMENT COMPANY so requires, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY may obtain, at YOUR cost,
      legal advice in writing as to the merited action in respect of the recovery of any SERVICE CHARGE
      contributions and YOU agree that the MANAGEMENT COMPANY is not bound to take action unless
      Counsel advises that the action should be taken and has a greater than 50% chance of success;
     if so required by the MANAGEMENT COMPANY, YOU will join in any action or proceedings arising out of
      the MANAGEMENT COMPANY's obligations in the previous paragraph; and
     all costs that are incurred by or on behalf of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY in connection with complying
      with the MANAGEMENT COMPANY's obligations under the previous paragraph form part of the SERVICE
      CHARGE.
EXCLUSIONS       AND    LIMITATIONS      ON    THE   MANAGEMENT         COMPANY'S        AND   THE    DEVELOPMENT
MANAGEMENT COMPANY'S LIABILITY

30. Although neither the DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY nor the MANAGEMENT COMPANY exclude
or limit in any way its liability to YOU where it would be unlawful to do so (which includes liability for death
or personal injury caused by the DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY or MANAGEMENT COMPANY's
negligence), neither the MANAGEMENT COMPANY  nor the DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY is liable to
YOU for any failure or interruption to the BUILDING SERVICES or the ESTATE SERVICES:
     where the failure or interruption is caused by the carrying out of inspections, maintenance, repair or
replacement works or by any mechanical breakdown or malfunction or for reasons beyond the control of
the DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY or the MANAGEMENT COMPANY, but in these circumstances the
DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY or the MANAGEMENT COMPANY will take reasonable steps to remedy
the situation as soon as it reasonably can;
     where workers or contractors are required to provide the relevant service or remedy any failure or
interruption and the DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY or the MANAGEMENT COMPANY has used
reasonable efforts to source appropriate workers or contractors but has not been able to do so;
     where the cause of the failure or the interruption is not reasonably obvious from a superficial visual
inspection until YOU have given the DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY or the MANAGEMENT COMPANY
written  notice  of  the   failure or interruption and the DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY or the
MANAGEMENT COMPANY has not remedied the situation within a reasonable period of getting that notice;
or
     where there has been UNINSURED DAMAGE and the DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY or the
MANAGEMENT COMPANY does not have sufficient funds to repair that UNINSURED DAMAGE.

                                                                                                               Page 20 of 56
31. YOU are not entitled to enforce any of the obligations on the part of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY in this
Chapter while any SERVICE CHARGE payable by YOU under THIS LEASE is in arrears or while YOU are
otherwise in substantial breach of any of YOUR obligations in THIS LEASE.

                                                                                                            Page 21 of 56
                                              CHAPTER 7: INSURANCE

BUILDING INSURANCE
1. The MANAGEMENT COMPANY will insure the BUILDING through a reputable insurance company or
underwriters. The total costs incurred by or on behalf of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY in connection with
insuring the BUILDING are recovered by the MANAGEMENT COMPANY from those who own property that
benefit from the BUILDING SERVICES (including YOU) as part of the SERVICE CHARGE.
2. The insurance of the BUILDING will cover the COMMON PARTS and the SERVICED AREAS. It will also cover
the fixtures and fittings in YOUR PROPERTY. Examples of fixtures and fittings are light fittings, fitted
cupboards, bathroom suites and associated plumbing, internal finishes to walls and ceilings and any
wooden flooring and floor tiles. The insurance will not cover carpets, curtains, blinds, furniture or any
other contents within YOUR PROPERTY.
3. The MANAGEMENT COMPANY will insure the BUILDING against the risks it considers to be reasonable in
all the circumstances but provided that cover is available in the UK market at a reasonable cost, the
insurance will cover the following risks:
      fire, explosion, lightning, earthquake, storm or tempest;
      aircraft (other than hostile aircraft) and other aerial devices and articles dropped from them;
      riot and civil commotion or malicious damage;
      bursting or overflowing of water tanks, apparatus or pipes;
      flood;
      impact by road vehicles;
      subsidence, landslip and heave;
      terrorism; and
      any risk required to be covered as a condition of mortgage finance as set out in the UK Finance
       Mortgage Lenders Handbook (or any successor publication).
4. So far as reasonably possible, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY will seek to ensure that insurance complies
with lenders’ general requirements as a condition of mortgage finance for residential property from time to
time (which at the date of THIS LEASE are set out in the UK Finance Mortgage Lenders Handbook) and will
seek to negotiate terms under which the insurer has no right of subrogation against YOU unless YOU have
acted negligently (i.e. failed to take proper care) or wilfully caused damage.

By way of explanation: Technically the MANAGEMENT COMPANY will be the person with the benefit of the insurance policy. If someone
negligently sets fire to the BUILDING, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY may be able to sue them, but it is usually easier to claim on the
insurance policy. The insurer then has a right of "subrogation": it can step into the MANAGEMENT COMPANY's shoes and sue the
person who caused the fire. If YOU were the person who caused the fire, this means the insurer could potentially sue YOU, which
would be unfair as YOU and the other owners of the LETTABLE UNITS are collectively paying for the insurance. As a solution to this
potential problem, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY will seek to ensure that the insurance policy states that it is for the benefit of the
MANAGEMENT COMPANY and all the owners of the LETTABLE UNITS, or that the insurance policy specifically prevents the insurer from
exercising subrogation rights against YOU and the other owners of LETTABLE UNITS. The insurer could however still sue YOU if YOU
do not comply with the terms of THIS LEASE or if damage had been caused wilfully.

5. The insurance of the BUILDING will cover the cost of rebuilding the BUILDING (including ancillary costs
such as site clearance, professional fees and the cost of insuring the site). The MANAGEMENT COMPANY
will request valuations at reasonable intervals so it may insure an appropriate sum. The insurance will
not cover the cost of alternative accommodation for the occupiers of YOUR PROPERTY if any damage
means that YOUR PROPERTY is unfit for occupation unless the MANAGEMENT COMPANY decides that it is
appropriate to insure this cost and it is specifically referred to in the applicable insurance policy. YOU

                                                                                                                             Page 22 of 56
should take out YOUR own insurance to cover this cost if required. The insurance will also not cover any
loss or damage caused by any work carried out in any LETTABLE UNIT, including YOUR PROPERTY by or
on behalf of the owners or occupiers of the LETTABLE UNITS.
6. If any part of the BUILDING is damaged by a risk against which the MANAGEMENT COMPANY has insured
(referred to in this Chapter as THE DAMAGE), the MANAGEMENT COMPANY will take all reasonable steps to
make the appropriate claim under the insurance policy and to recover any sums due in respect of THE
DAMAGE from any other person.
7. The MANAGEMENT COMPANY will use the money that it receives from the insurers and any other person
in respect of THE DAMAGE to seek to repair THE DAMAGE as quickly as reasonably possible.
8. Where repairing THE DAMAGE requires planning permission or any other permission or consents, the
MANAGEMENT COMPANY will seek to obtain these (but will not be required to issue any proceedings or
appeals).
9. If it is not possible to repair THE DAMAGE (for example because planning permission has been refused)
and YOUR PROPERTY is unfit for occupation for a continuous period of 3 years, the LANDLORD may terminate
THIS LEASE and the MANAGEMENT COMPANY will pay any money received from the insurers and any other
money that may be received in compensation for THE DAMAGE (less amounts spent in seeking to repair
THE DAMAGE) to the LANDLORD. (This is an obligation owed by the MANAGEMENT COMPANY to the
LANDLORD). The LANDLORD will then divide this money between the LANDLORD and the owners of the
LETTABLE UNITS in a fair and reasonable way with regard to the nature of their respective interests and
whether any of the LETTABLE UNITS are fit for occupation.
10. YOU will not be required to pay any SERVICE CHARGE for any period when YOUR PROPERTY is not fit for
occupation due to THE DAMAGE.

OTHER INSURANCE

11. The MANAGEMENT COMPANY may choose to insure an amount equal to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY's
reasonable estimate of the contributions to the SERVICE CHARGE by the owners of the LETTABLE UNITS
towards costs of the ESTATE SERVICES for a period of up to 3 years against the risk that those
contributions are not paid due to damage to the BUILDING.
12. The MANAGEMENT COMPANY will also arrange directors' and officers' liability insurance to cover a sum
considered to be appropriate by the MANAGEMENT COMPANY to cover the risk of compensation claims
being made against relevant directors and officers of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY (and other appropriate
personnel carrying out duties on behalf of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY where the MANAGEMENT COMPANY
considers it appropriate cover such personnel) and may arrange insurance to cover a sum considered
to be appropriate by the MANAGEMENT COMPANY (or if applicable, as required by any hiring terms) relating
to any employees or staff hired by the MANAGEMENT COMPANY or to any FACILITIES in the BUILDING
(excluding those forming part of any LETTABLE UNIT) or the COMMUNAL AREAS.
13. The MANAGEMENT COMPANY will also arrange property owner's and public liability insurance to cover
a sum considered to be appropriate by the MANAGEMENT COMPANY to cover the risk of claims against
the LANDLORD or the MANAGEMENT COMPANY in relation to the BUILDING (excluding the LETTABLE UNITS)
and the COMMUNAL AREAS.
14. The MANAGEMENT COMPANY may arrange any other reasonable insurance that may from time to time
be appropriate to cover a sum considered to be appropriate by the MANAGEMENT COMPANY.
                                                                                                            Page 23 of 56
UNINSURED DAMAGE

15. If there is any damage to the COMMUNAL AREAS, COMMON PARTS, the SERVICED AREAS or the fixtures
and fittings in YOUR PROPERTY and the cost of repairing that damage is not covered by insurance proceeds
or funds received from any other person, that damage will be UNINSURED DAMAGE.
16. Except as provided below in the case of CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE, the cost of repairing any UNINSURED
DAMAGE that relates to:
        the COMMON PARTS, the SERVICED AREAS or the fixtures and fittings in YOUR PROPERTY will be
         treated as a cost to be incurred by the MANAGEMENT COMPANY in connection with providing the
         BUILDING SERVICES and it will form part of the SERVICE CHARGE; and
        the COMMUNAL AREAS will be treated as a cost to be incurred by the MANAGEMENT COMPANY in
         connection with providing the ESTATE SERVICES and it will form part of the SERVICE CHARGE.
17. Where the MANAGEMENT COMPANY does not have enough money to repair the UNINSURED DAMAGE,
the MANAGEMENT COMPANY will seek funds by revising its written budget which shows the ESTIMATED
SERVICE CHARGE for that SERVICE CHARGE PERIOD, as set out in more detail in Chapter 6.
18. Where the UNINSURED DAMAGE means that YOUR PROPERTY is not fit for occupation, if in the reasonable
opinion of both the MANAGEMENT COMPANY and the LANDLORD, having sought YOUR opinion and that of
other affected owners of LETTABLE UNITS, it is considered unlikely that sufficient funds can be obtained
through the SERVICE CHARGE for there to be a reasonable prospect of YOUR PROPERTY being fit for
occupation within the period of 3 years from the date of the UNINSURED DAMAGE, the MANAGEMENT
COMPANY or the LANDLORD will notify YOU that the UNINSURED DAMAGE will be treated as CATASTROPHIC
DAMAGE.
19. Repairing CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE or UNINSURED DAMAGE that has the potential to be designated as
CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE does not form part of the BUILDING SERVICES or the ESTATE SERVICES.
20. Following CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE, the LANDLORD will take such steps as may be reasonable in the
circumstances to seek to minimise the financial loss to YOU and to the LANDLORD. The LANDLORD
acknowledges that those steps may include transferring its freehold interest in the BUILDING or in the
BUILDING and other property to YOU and others with limited title guarantee and on standard terms, adjusted
as appropriate for the circumstances. Where YOU and the LANDLORD do not agree what steps should be
taken or how they should be taken, YOU and the LANDLORD will be bound by the decision of one
independent surveyor and one independent solicitor, each with no less than 10 years relevant experience
who will be appointed by their relevant professional governing bodies. Any reasonable costs to be incurred
by the LANDLORD in connection with its obligations in this paragraph must be paid by YOU (or where
applicable, a reasonable proportion of those costs).

By way of explanation: This clause deals with a very rare situation and sets out what will happen as a last resort. "Limited title
guarantee" means that the LANDLORD will only give limited confirmations as to the rights and other matters affecting YOUR PROPERTY
and limited commitments in relation to the transfer of it, given YOU will be the owner of YOUR PROPERTY and will usually know more
about it than the LANDLORD does.
21. YOU will not be required to pay any SERVICE CHARGE relating to the BUILDING SERVICES for any period
when YOUR PROPERTY is not fit for occupation due to UNINSURED DAMAGE or CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE.
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS IN RELATION TO INSURANCE

                                                                                                                             Page 24 of 56
22. When repairing THE DAMAGE or any UNINSURED DAMAGE, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY is not required to
seek to put the damaged part of the BUILDING or the ESTATE into precisely the same state as before that
damage occurred so long as the BUILDING and the ESTATE are reasonably comparable to their state before
that damage.
23. The MANAGEMENT COMPANY will not agree to terms for the insurance which are unusual in the market,
but YOU acknowledge that the insurance policies will be subject to any excesses, exclusions, limitations
and conditions that are imposed by the insurer or which are reasonably negotiated. YOU acknowledge that
this means that part of most claims will be uninsured, and even if the MANAGEMENT COMPANY has complied
with all obligations in this Chapter, some damage, costs or losses may be entirely uninsured.

By way of explanation: An "excess" is the initial amount which the insured has to bear on any insurance claim. It may be a sum
of money, e.g. the first £100 of any claim, or a percentage, e.g. the first 5%. An excess is to discourage small claims and it
reduces insurance costs. An "exclusion" is a risk that the insurer will not cover.

24. The MANAGEMENT COMPANY will give YOU sufficient details of the insurance policies to enable YOU to
understand YOUR obligations in this Chapter and to confirm that the MANAGEMENT COMPANY has
complied with its obligations in this Chapter. The MANAGEMENT COMPANY will give YOU a summary of the
insurance cover relating to the BUILDING whenever YOU reasonably request it and will advise YOU if there
is any material change to any insurance policy. All information referred to in this paragraph will be
supplied to YOU free of charge.
25. YOU must comply with the conditions of the insurance policies and any insurers' requirements or
recommendations that affect YOUR PROPERTY or its use and must not to do anything that may increase the
cost of obtaining any of the insurance referred to in this Chapter. If the cost of obtaining any of the
insurance referred to in this Chapter is increased due to YOUR failure to comply with any term in THIS
LEASE, YOU must pay to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY a sum equal to that increase.
26. If there is any loss or damage to the BUILDING (excluding YOUR PROPERTY) or to the ESTATE arising out
of or in connection with YOUR act or default that is not covered in full by the proceeds from any of the
insurance policies (including where insurer is permitted to refuse to pay those proceeds because of YOUR
act or default), YOU must pay to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY a sum equal to the value of such loss and the
cost of repairing such damage (less any part of the relevant insurance proceeds that are receivable). Until
this sum is paid, YOU may not enforce any of the obligations in this Chapter and any provisions relating to
circumstances in which YOU will not be required to pay SERVICE CHARGE will not apply.


                                                                                                                          Page 25 of 56
  CHAPTER 8: HANDOVER AND MEMBERSHIP OF THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY

HANDOVER

1. At the date of THIS LEASE, the directors of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY have been appointed by the
LANDLORD (and may include the LANDLORD). The directors of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY have employed
managing agents to carry out the obligations on the part of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY in THIS LEASE on
usual market terms which include a provision allowing the directors of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY to
terminate the appointment of the managing agents if they fail to carry out their obligations.
2. At an appropriate time, the LANDLORD will require that the directors of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY are
replaced. The appropriate time is anticipated to be 6 months after the grant of the final lease or transfer
of property on the ESTATE that is intended to be let or transferred by the LANDLORD, but the LANDLORD
may extend this period where it is reasonable to do so. The MANAGEMENT COMPANY will notify all those
who hold leases or freehold interests on the ESTATE granted or transferred by the LANDLORD and who
are under obligations to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY to contribute to the SERVICE CHARGE (referred to as
the RESIDENTS) that the MANAGEMENT COMPANY is ready to be handed over to the RESIDENTS. The
LANDLORD and the MANAGEMENT COMPANY will take the necessary steps to appoint any RESIDENT as a
director of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY who has notified the LANDLORD that they want to be a director
within 4 weeks of that RESIDENT being notified that the MANAGEMENT COMPANY is ready to be handed
over.
3. If fewer than 2 RESIDENTS have been appointed as directors of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY within 4
weeks of the RESIDENTS being notified that the MANAGEMENT COMPANY is ready to be handed over, the
MANAGEMENT COMPANY may appoint a professional director (or where no RESIDENTS have been
appointed as director, 2 professional directors) to perform the function of director of the MANAGEMENT
COMPANY on terms that require that professional director to allow any RESIDENT that wants to become a
director of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY to do so. In addition, 6 weeks after the notification that the
MANAGEMENT COMPANY is ready to be handed over, the LANDLORD will require the directors of the
MANAGEMENT COMPANY that have been appointed by the LANDLORD, excluding any professional director,
to resign.

MEMBERSHIP

4. As soon as possible after the grant of THIS LEASE, YOU (here meaning only the person named as
PARTY (3) at the top of the page headed "Introduction") must become a member of the MANAGEMENT
COMPANY and must promptly take any reasonable steps required by the MANAGEMENT COMPANY, in order
to do so, including entering into any documentation required to effect such membership.


                                                                                                            Page 26 of 56
              CHAPTER 9: MAINTAINING AND ALTERING YOUR PROPERTY
1. YOU must keep YOUR PROPERTY clean, well decorated and in good repair. This includes keeping the
inside of windows that form part of YOUR PROPERTY clean, keeping any CONDUITS that form part of YOUR
PROPERTY in good working order and condition and maintaining any FACILITIES that form part of YOUR
PROPERTY in accordance with any relevant regulations, the manufacturer’s recommendations and any
reasonable requirements notified to YOU by the MANAGEMENT COMPANY from time to time.
2. YOU must pay for and arrange for the replacement of any broken glass in any window, door, balcony or
patio which forms part of YOUR PROPERTY but YOU must notify the MANAGEMENT COMPANY, comply with
any reasonable requirements notified to YOU by the MANAGEMENT COMPANY, comply with all health and
safety requirements and replace the broken glass with glass of a similar type, colour and quality to that
being repaired.
3. Where the door that is used to enter YOUR PROPERTY from the BUILDING forms part of YOUR PROPERTY,
YOU must get the prior consent of the LANDLORD to replace that door or make any changes to the
appearance of that door from outside YOUR PROPERTY and (unless to do so would result in YOU paying
more than one CONSENT FEE under THIS LEASE in respect of the same set of changes or replacement) pay
a CONSENT FEE to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY.
4. If YOUR PROPERTY includes any patio or the structure of any garage, YOU must get the prior consent of
the LANDLORD to make any changes to the appearance of the patio or the garage (unless that change will
not be visible to any person apart from those occupying YOUR PROPERTY) and (unless to do so would result
in YOU paying more than one CONSENT FEE under THIS LEASE in respect of the same set of changes) pay
a CONSENT FEE to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY.
5. For the purposes of this Chapter, "the same set of changes" and "the same set of changes or
replacement" means a group of changes and/or replacement, each of which requires the LANDLORD'S
consent under THIS LEASE but for which YOU have made only one single application for such consent to
the LANDLORD. The MANAGEMENT COMPANY may from time to time prescribe further or different detail on
what is meant by "the same set of changes" and/or "the same set of changes or replacement" in the
ESTATE REGULATIONS.
6. If YOU do not comply with YOUR obligations in this Chapter, either the LANDLORD or the MANAGEMENT
COMPANY may give YOU notice stating what work needs to be carried out to YOUR PROPERTY and a
reasonable deadline by which that work must be done. This deadline will usually be 3 months but it may
be less if appropriate. If YOU do not comply with that notice, the LANDLORD or the MANAGEMENT COMPANY
may go into YOUR PROPERTY to carry out the work and YOU must pay to the LANDLORD or the MANAGEMENT
COMPANY (as directed) all costs incurred in connection with that work when asked to do so.
7. YOU are not responsible for repairing damage to YOUR PROPERTY to the extent that the insurers cover
the cost of the repair under the insurance policy relating to the BUILDING as described in Chapter 7.
8. If YOU cause any damage to the BUILDING or to the ESTATE, YOU must pay to the LANDLORD or the
MANAGEMENT COMPANY (or to any other person as directed by the MANAGEMENT COMPANY) the cost of
repairing that damage (except to the extent that the insurers cover that cost as described in Chapter 7).
9. YOU may not carry out any work to any part of the BUILDING or the ESTATE except on YOUR PROPERTY.
For example YOU must not install or make any changes to CONDUITS or FACILITIES that do not form part of
YOUR PROPERTY or make changes to or cut into any load bearing walls, external walls or other structural
parts of the BUILDING.
                                                                                                            Page 27 of 56
10. YOU may not make any of the following alterations to YOUR PROPERTY:
     install air conditioning units or any other FACILITY on any balcony or in windows that form part of
      YOUR PROPERTY; or
     while the LANDLORD is developing the ESTATE, erect aerials or satellite dishes anywhere on YOUR
      PROPERTY but once the LANDLORD has finished developing the ESTATE, you may erect satellite
      dishes or aerials on YOUR PROPERTY provided that you first obtain consent, where required, from
      any authority (including any AUTHORITY) and that when erecting, maintaining and operating such
      items, you follow appropriate guidance issued by any authority (including any AUTHORITY).
11. YOU may not make any of the following alterations to YOUR PROPERTY without obtaining the prior
consent of the LANDLORD (which may be given subject to reasonable conditions) and paying a CONSENT
FEE to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY but the LANDLORD will not refuse consent unless it is reasonable to do
so:
     make holes in load bearing walls or other structural parts or external walls that abut the internal
      boundaries of YOUR PROPERTY other than for the purposes of hanging pictures, erecting shelving,
      attaching furniture to the wall and other similar purposes;
     make holes in any glass forming part of YOUR PROPERTY;
     remove or alter any internal wall/partition within YOUR PROPERTY;
     alter, add to or remove any CONDUITS or FACILITIES at YOUR PROPERTY; or
     change the type of floor coverings at YOUR PROPERTY (and consent may be refused if the LANDLORD
      believes that YOUR proposed floor coverings may cause a nuisance to anyone else in the form of
      increased noise or for any other reasonable reason).
Any consent given to any alterations at YOUR PROPERTY does not prevent the LANDLORD or the
MANAGEMENT COMPANY from subsequently requiring YOU to remove or make changes to that alteration if
it is causing nuisance, annoyance, loss, damage or harm to any person.
12. Any work that YOU carry out to YOUR PROPERTY must be carried out using good quality and appropriate
materials by a person with appropriate skill and competency for the nature of the work in question and in
accordance with any applicable codes of practice, laws and regulations. YOU will require that anyone
carrying out work in YOUR PROPERTY has sufficient public liability insurance to cover YOU and others
against any loss or damage that may be caused.

                                                                                                            Page 28 of 56

3. YOU must not do anything at YOUR PROPERTY or on the ESTATE that causes nuisance, annoyance, loss,
damage or harm to the LANDLORD, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY, the DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT

       stored and used items which are consistent with normal residential use such as alcohol, matches
       and cleaning products, in quantities that are appropriate for normal residential use);
      do or fail to do anything in relation to YOUR PROPERTY or its use or occupation that may cause any
       liability to be imposed on the LANDLORD or the MANAGEMENT COMPANY; or
      cause a legal nuisance.

time to time. These ESTATE REGULATIONS will be directions and prohibitions imposed by the MANAGEMENT
COMPANY for the general benefit of all who occupy or use the BUILDING or the ESTATE. The ESTATE

considered appropriate by the DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY in the interests of good estate
management.
7. If YOU receive a written communication from any authority (including but not limited to any AUTHORITY)
relating to any legal obligation affecting YOUR PROPERTY or the BUILDING or any other notice, document or
communication from any person that may affect YOUR PROPERTY or the BUILDING, YOU must send a copy
to the LANDLORD and the MANAGEMENT COMPANY within one week of YOU receiving it.

                                                                                                                   Page 29 of 56
8. If the LANDLORD or the MANAGEMENT COMPANY asks YOU to, YOU must make or support the LANDLORD
and/or the MANAGEMENT COMPANY in making objections or representations in relation to any notice,
document or communication referred to in the preceding paragraph as directed by the LANDLORD or the
MANAGEMENT COMPANY. Any reasonable costs that YOU incur in connection with following the directions of
the LANDLORD in this paragraph will be refunded to YOU by the LANDLORD and any reasonable costs that
YOU incur in connection with following the directions of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY will be refunded to YOU
by the MANAGEMENT COMPANY.
9. YOU must at YOUR own cost comply with all laws, regulations and legal obligations that relate to YOUR
PROPERTY or YOUR use of YOUR PROPERTY or the exercise of any rights granted to YOU by THIS LEASE,
including any applicable planning controls in force from time to time. As part of complying with the rights,
obligations, restrictions and other matters referred to under the heading "Other rights" in Chapter 4, so far
as they relate to YOUR PROPERTY or the use of it or the exercise of the rights granted to YOU by THIS LEASE,
YOU must not do anything that may interfere with any such rights, obligations, restrictions or other matters.
10. YOU must not:
     make any application for planning permission in relation to YOUR PROPERTY without obtaining the
      prior consent of the LANDLORD (which may be given subject to reasonable conditions) and (unless
      to do so would result in YOU paying more than one CONSENT FEE under this Lease in respect of the
      subject of the relevant planning application) paying a CONSENT FEE to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY
      but the LANDLORD will not refuse consent unless it is reasonable to do so;
     make any application to the local authority for a resident's parking permit;
     obstruct any window in YOUR PROPERTY; or
     give up, temporarily transfer or share any right which YOUR PROPERTY benefits from or grant anyone
      any new right over YOUR PROPERTY except to the extent permitted by Chapter 11 (Disposals of Your
      Property).
11. YOU must give notice to the LANDLORD and to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY and to the DEVELOPMENT
MANAGEMENT COMPANY as soon as YOU become aware of any damage to or defect in the BUILDING or the

or which may need to be notified to the relevant insurers.

                                                                                                             Page 30 of 56
                            CHAPTER 11: DISPOSALS OF YOUR PROPERTY

TRANSFERS OF THIS LEASE

1. YOU may transfer YOUR interest in the whole of YOUR PROPERTY by transferring THIS LEASE but YOU must
not sub-divide YOUR PROPERTY or transfer only part of YOUR PROPERTY.
2. The MANAGEMENT COMPANY will seek to ensure that the holder of THIS LEASE from time to time is a
member of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY and that anyone who has transferred their interest in THIS LEASE
ends their membership of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY. On YOU transferring THIS LEASE, YOU and the
MANAGEMENT COMPANY will take all necessary steps to terminate YOUR membership of the MANAGEMENT
COMPANY.
3. If THIS LEASE has been transferred to YOU, YOU must:
      no later than the date on which the transfer deed completes, enter into a deed of covenant in the
       form set out in Appendix 1 agreeing to comply with the obligations on YOU in THIS LEASE; and
      within one month of the date on which the transfer deed completes:
              o    notify the LANDLORD and give a copy of the completed transfer deed to the LANDLORD;
              o    notify the MANAGEMENT COMPANY and give a copy of the completed transfer deed to the
                   MANAGEMENT COMPANY;
              o    give to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY a copy of the completed deed of covenant referred to
                   above;
              o    take any reasonable steps required by the MANAGEMENT COMPANY so YOU become a
                   member of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY;
              o    notify both the LANDLORD and the MANAGEMENT COMPANY of YOUR full name and the
                   address which the LANDLORD and the MANAGEMENT COMPANY should use to give YOU any
                   notices under THIS LEASE; and
              o    pay the MANAGEMENT COMPANY an EVENT FEE.

By way of explanation: It is important that, if YOU sell YOUR PROPERTY in the future, the future owners of YOUR PROPERTY will be
bound by YOUR obligations in THIS LEASE, so that the BUILDING and the ESTATE can be maintained and effectively managed in the
future. To achieve this, the future owners will enter in a 'deed of covenant', which is a written promise to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY
that the future owners will comply with YOUR obligations in THIS LEASE. The form of 'deed of covenant' is at Appendix 1.
4. Following receipt of all the notifications, documents and fees referred to in the preceding paragraph and
YOU becoming a member of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY will give a letter of
consent to YOU to confirm that the preceding paragraph has been complied with sufficiently to allow YOU
to satisfy the restriction referred to at LR13 of the PRESCRIBED CLAUSES.
5. If YOU have become the owner of THIS LEASE as a result of death or bankruptcy, or other transfer by
operation of law, YOU must within one month of that event:
      notify the LANDLORD and give a copy of any reasonably requested documents to the LANDLORD;
      notify the MANAGEMENT COMPANY and give a copy of any reasonably requested documents to the
       MANAGEMENT COMPANY together with the EVENT FEE; and
      notify both the LANDLORD and the MANAGEMENT COMPANY of YOUR full name and the address which
       the LANDLORD and the MANAGEMENT COMPANY should use to give YOU any notices under THIS LEASE.

                                                                                                                              Page 31 of 56
However, YOU may not enforce any obligations in THIS LEASE on the part of the LANDLORD or the
MANAGEMENT COMPANY (to the extent that this exclusion is permitted by law) unless YOU have become a
member of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY and entered into and given to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY a copy
of the deed of covenant in substantially the form set out in Appendix 1, adjusted as appropriate for the
circumstances.

MORTGAGES

6. YOU may mortgage YOUR interest in the whole of YOUR PROPERTY (but not part).
7. If YOU mortgage YOUR interest in the whole of YOUR PROPERTY (including any re-mortgage), YOU must
within one month of the mortgage date:
      notify the LANDLORD and give  the LANDLORD  a copy of the completed mortgage; and
      notify the MANAGEMENT COMPANY and give the MANAGEMENT COMPANY a copy of the completed
       mortgage and an EVENT FEE.
GRANTING SUB-LEASES AND SHARING

8. YOU may have lodgers in YOUR PROPERTY so long as they live with YOU as part of YOUR household and
YOU are not carrying on the business of providing accommodation.
9. YOU may let the whole of YOUR PROPERTY (but not part) by granting a sub-lease on the conditions that:
      YOU must not grant any lease or a licence at a premium and YOU must not grant any lease except
       for an "assured shorthold tenancy", as this expression is defined in the Housing Act 1988, for a term
       of at least 6 months;
      YOU must require that any occupier of YOUR PROPERTY must not act in any way that would put YOU
       in breach of YOUR obligations in THIS LEASE;
      YOU must prohibit any further sub-letting by YOUR tenant; and
      YOU must comply with all legal obligations and regulations that are applicable to YOU as a residential
       landlord.

By way of explanation: A 'premium' is a lump sum paid by a tenant to a landlord at the start of a lease, in the same way as YOU
are paying the PRICE to the LANDLORD in return for THIS LEASE. YOU are not allowed to accept a premium if YOU let or licence YOUR
PROPERTY.

10. If YOU are not an individual, YOU must not allow YOUR PROPERTY to be occupied by anyone except on
the basis of a sub-lease to an individual or individuals that satisfies the requirements in the preceding
paragraph.
11. If YOU grant any sub-lease of YOUR PROPERTY, YOU must within one month of the date of that sub-
lease:
      notify the LANDLORD and give the LANDLORD with a copy of the completed sub-lease; and
      notify the MANAGEMENT COMPANY and give the MANAGEMENT COMPANY a copy of the completed sub-
       lease and an EVENT FEE.

                                                                                                                            Page 32 of 56
   CHAPTER 12: LANDLORD'S OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO CONSTRUCTION OF
                                                  THE ESTATE

CONSTRUCTION OF ESTATE ROADS AND ESTATE SEWERS

1. The LANDLORD will construct or procure the construction and/or maintenance of the ESTATE ROADS and
the ESTATE SEWERS serving YOUR PROPERTY to the standard required for adoption by the relevant
AUTHORITY and the LANDLORD will indemnify YOU against all liabilities in respect of the cost of initial
construction and maintenance of the ESTATE ROADS and ESTATE SEWERS  until their adoption.
2. YOU accept that the LANDLORD is not obliged to seek the adoption of the ESTATE ROADS and that the
ESTATE ROADS may remain private and that YOU are not entitled to require and will not require the ESTATE
ROADS to be adopted. YOU agree that YOU will not raise any objection and that YOU will consent to any
works undertaken under Part IV of the Highways Act 1980 in respect of the new roads and new FOOTPATHS
and/or to the release of any guarantee or other form of security made by or on behalf of the LANDLORD
under sections 219 to 221 inclusive of the Highways Act 1980.
YOU also accept that any bond paid by the LANDLORD will be released back to the LANDLORD by the
relevant AUTHORITY.
3. YOU will pay the LANDLORD on demand any sum YOU receive from any AUTHORITY by way of
compensation for or refund of any security or deposit paid by or on behalf of the LANDLORD relating to the
construction and use of the ESTATE ROADS or the ESTATE SEWERS.
SECTION 106 AGREEMENT

4. The LANDLORD will indemnify YOU in respect of liabilities (to include but not limited to providing on or off
site infrastructure and financial contributions for local and/or other community services) imposed by the
SECTION 106 AGREEMENT (AYLESBURY) and the SECTION 106 AGREEMENT (BUCKINGHAMSHIRE) so long as
any liabilities were not intended to be ongoing so as to bind future owners of properties on the Estate but
only in so far as those relate to the PROPERTY and  not so as to be personally liable after the LANDLORD
has parted with all its interests in the ESTATE.

TO WHOM LANDLORD'S OBLIGATIONS IN THIS CHAPTER ARE OWED

5. All obligations on the part of the LANDLORD in this Chapter are owed to YOU and to the MANAGEMENT
COMPANY.


                                                                                                              Page 33 of 56
                                         CHAPTER 13: NOTICES
1. Any references to notices or notifying and any requirement to send a document or information means
that the notice or the document or information being sent must be in writing unless otherwise stated.
2. Notices and documents or information being sent may be delivered by hand to the recipient or sent by
ordinary post or registered or recorded delivery post addressed to the recipient at their last known address
in the United Kingdom or address for service in the United Kingdom. Anything sent by registered or
recorded delivery post is deemed to have been delivered at the time it is proven to have been posted.
Anything sent by ordinary post is deemed to have been received the second business day after posting.
3. Alternatively, a notice, document or information may be given by any other appropriate method such as
email, but is not assumed to have been given until the recipient acknowledges receipt. Notices, documents
or information may not be given by fax.
4. As at the date of THIS LEASE:
     YOUR last known address will be YOUR PROPERTY;
     the MANAGEMENT COMPANY's last known address will be its registered office; and
     the LANDLORD's last known address will be its registered office.
5. The MANAGEMENT COMPANY and the LANDLORD may change their last known address by giving notice
of their new address to YOU.
6. YOU agree that whenever YOU are not resident in the United Kingdom, YOU will provide the LANDLORD
and the MANAGEMENT COMPANY with an address for service in the United Kingdom.
7. To change YOUR last known address or address for service in the United Kingdom, YOU must:
     notify the LANDLORD; and
     notify the MANAGEMENT COMPANY and give to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY an EVENT FEE.
Until these notifications are received, any notice, document or information sent to YOUR previous address
will be deemed to have been sent to the correct address even if YOU do not receive it.


                                                                                                            Page 34 of 56
               CHAPTER 14: ENFORCEMENT AND EXTENT OF OBLIGATIONS

1. YOU owe YOUR obligations to both the LANDLORD and the MANAGEMENT COMPANY unless it is stated
that the obligation is owed only to the LANDLORD or that it is owed only to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY or
that it is owed to some other person either in addition to or instead of the LANDLORD and/or the
MANAGEMENT COMPANY. The LANDLORD and the MANAGEMENT COMPANY each owe their obligations to
YOU except where it is stated that the MANAGEMENT COMPANY owes an obligation to the LANDLORD or
that the LANDLORD owes an obligation to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY or that the LANDLORD owes an
obligation to YOU and to the MANAGEMENT COMPANY.
2. Where YOU includes more than one person, each person named will be jointly and severally liable for
all the obligations on YOUR part in THIS LEASE. The word YOU also applies to any person to whom THIS
LEASE is transferred as well as the person named as YOU in THIS LEASE. The word YOUR is used in
relation to YOU to indicate things belonging to YOU, for example YOUR obligations are obligations owed
by YOU and YOUR opinion is the opinion expressed by YOU.
By way of explanation: Being jointly and severally liable means that where YOU are more than one person, the MANAGEMENT
COMPANY or whomever else YOU owe an obligation to under THIS LEASE can ask just one or some of YOU to comply with that
obligation. For example, if YOU have not paid YOUR SHARE of the SERVICE CHARGE, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY could require just
one of the group of people comprising YOU to pay the whole of the amount due.
3. The word LANDLORD also applies to any person to whom the LANDLORD's interest is transferred (or
anyone entitled to the immediate reversion to THIS LEASE) as well as the person named as LANDLORD in
THIS LEASE.
4. Upon BDW Trading Limited transferring its interest in YOUR PROPERTY, from and including the date
on the transfer (or if applicable, the date the transfer takes place by operation of law) BDW Trading
Limited will no longer be liable for any breach of the obligations on the part of the LANDLORD in THIS
LEASE. This does not affect YOUR rights or any rights of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY in relation to any
breach by BDW Trading Limited of the obligations on the part of the LANDLORD which occurred before
the transfer.
5. The LANDLORD intends to grant every new lease of the other APARTMENTS in the BUILDING that are sold
for a premium (i.e. value) in a similar form to THIS LEASE with obligations on the holder of that lease that
are similar to those entered into by YOU in THIS LEASE, so far as this is appropriate to the property in
question. Different provisions will be included in any lease of any APARTMENT that is not sold for a premium.
6. The LANDLORD will not be liable to YOU if any person owning or occupying any other LETTABLE UNIT
does not comply with their obligations in their lease and nothing in THIS LEASE requires the LANDLORD to
issue any proceedings or take any action to enforce those obligations.
7. Subject to YOU complying fully with YOUR obligations in the next paragraph, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY
will take reasonable steps to enforce the obligations owed to it by the owners of the other LETTABLE UNITS
where THIS LEASE includes a similar obligation.
8. YOU agree with the MANAGEMENT COMPANY that:
      YOU will indemnify and reimburse the MANAGEMENT COMPANY against all costs of complying with the
       MANAGEMENT         COMPANY's       obligations      in   the   previous      paragraph      (including     reasonable
       reimbursement for the time spent by the MANAGEMENT COMPANY or by someone authorised by it);

                                                                                                                      Page 35 of 56
      YOU will provide such security in cleared funds as the MANAGEMENT COMPANY thinks fit and YOU
       agree that the MANAGEMENT COMPANY is not required to take or continue any action or incur any
       costs under its obligations in the previous paragraph until YOU or YOUR mortgagee has done so;
      if the MANAGEMENT COMPANY so requires, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY may obtain, at YOUR cost,
       legal advice in writing as to the merited action in respect of the allegations underlying the request
       for enforcement and YOU agree that the MANAGEMENT COMPANY is not bound to take action unless
       Counsel advises that the action should be taken and has a greater than 50% chance of success;
      if so required by the MANAGEMENT COMPANY, YOU will join in any action or proceedings arising out of
       the MANAGEMENT COMPANY's obligations in the previous paragraph; and
      all costs that are incurred by or on behalf of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY in connection with complying
       with the MANAGEMENT COMPANY's obligations under the previous paragraph form part of the SERVICE
       CHARGE.
9. YOU acknowledge that the owners of the other APARTMENTS in the BUILDING may require the
MANAGEMENT COMPANY to take action against YOU to enforce YOUR obligations under THIS LEASE and that
the MANAGEMENT COMPANY may take action against YOU or any other person who owes obligations to the
MANAGEMENT COMPANY even where no owner of any APARTMENT or any other LETTABLE UNITS has
requested that it do so.
10. Any obligation or agreement on YOUR part in THIS LEASE includes an obligation to make sure that
anyone that YOU have invited onto the ESTATE complies with that obligation or agreement. This includes
members of YOUR family, visitors, anyone YOU have invited to carry out work at YOUR PROPERTY, lodgers
and sub-tenants. If they do not comply, YOU will be responsible and liable in the same way as if YOU had
breached the obligation or agreement yourself.
11. Any obligation or agreement on the part of the LANDLORD in THIS LEASE includes an obligation to make
sure that its staff, anyone it invites to carry out work on the ESTATE and anyone authorised by the LANDLORD
complies with that obligation or agreement. If they do not comply, the LANDLORD will be responsible and
liable.
12. Any obligation or agreement on the part of the MANAGEMENT COMPANY in THIS LEASE includes an
obligation to make sure that its staff, anyone it invites to carry out work on the ESTATE and anyone
authorised by the MANAGEMENT COMPANY complies with that obligation or agreement. If they do not
comply, the MANAGEMENT COMPANY will be responsible and liable.
13. The LANDLORD may terminate THIS LEASE by re-entering YOUR PROPERTY (or a part of it in the name
of the whole) itself or by an authorised agent at any time if YOU are in breach of any of YOUR obligations
in THIS LEASE or if YOU have failed to pay any money due to the LANDLORD within 21 days of the due
date. Before issuing any proceedings to terminate THIS LEASE, the LANDLORD will give notice of any
breach in respect of which it proposes to re-enter the Premises to any mortgagee whose interest is
entered on the registered title of THIS LEASE at the Land Registry at the address specified on such title
and if any such mortgagee confirms in writing to the LANDLORD within 30 days of the notice that it wishes
to remedy the breach, the LANDLORD will not issue proceedings to terminate THIS LEASE unless the
mortgagee fails to remedy the breach within a reasonable period.

By way of explanation: If YOU do not comply with YOUR obligations in THIS LEASE, then ultimately the LANDLORD may be able to
